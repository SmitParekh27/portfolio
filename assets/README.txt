PROFILE PHOTO SETUP
===================

To add your profile photo:

1. Place your photo in this folder (assets/)
2. Rename it to: profile.jpg
   (or update the path in index.html if you prefer a different name)

Recommended specifications:
- Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- Dimensions: 500x500px or higher (square aspect ratio)
- File size: Under 500KB for optimal loading
- Quality: High-resolution, well-lit professional headshot

The photo will be displayed in a circular frame (120x120px) on the hero card.

If no photo is provided, the fallback "SP" initials will be displayed instead.
